( ) when server is added, check via rcon call whether its working
(x) add kick msg to kick



server monitor: forceplayers rework
-> auths not displayed
-> stats not updating?
-> teams not updating
-> how does auth-whois look like for non-authed ppl
-> swaproles not working

( ) parseRconPlayers can be empty! - why/how?

( ) !expire 15m timer until autoremove
( ) admin cmds to lookup user/auths/ips etc
( ) playerprofiles (stats stats stats (matches played etc...))
( ) match history

// Discord:
( ) reconnect (resume) function
( ) get gateway if fails to connect
( ) ability to reply to heartbeat event
(x) reconnect if WebSocket was shut down

IDEA:
- display newly connected/disconnected people in the chat
- ringer system? how would that look like
- report/auto-ban system
- multiple guilds

ABORT: currently if 5min are over, match will be aborted - good?

REPORT SYSTEM:
!report auth leave/noshow/insult/troll
to defend yourself: !excuse <reason>
if 3 games a report
msg to admins to review case !review <number>
!accept !decline
suspended for 1d, 3d, 1w, 2w, 1m, 3m, perm
show bans and time !banlist
ability to ban ppl as admin !permban <auth> ? if temp bans wished: !ban <auth> <1d> ex.?
end bans: !pardon <auth>

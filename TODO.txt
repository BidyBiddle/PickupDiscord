IDEA:
- display newly connected/disconnected people in the chat
- ringer system? how would that look like
- report/auto-ban system
- multiple guilds

ABORT: currently if 5min are over, match will be aborted - good?

REPORT SYSTEM:
!report auth leave/noshow/insult/troll
to defend yourself: !excuse <reason>
if 3 games a report
msg to admins to review case !review <number>
!accept !decline
suspended for 1d, 3d, 1w, 2w, 1m, 3m, perm
show bans and time !banlist
ability to ban ppl as admin !permban <auth> ? if temp bans wished: !ban <auth> <1d> ex.?
end bans: !pardon <auth>
